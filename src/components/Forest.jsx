                            <li><b>Peak Years:</b> Significant spikes in tree cover loss occurred around 2004, 2012, and 2016, reaching above 20 million trees lost.</li>
                            <li><b>Decline in Recent Years:</b>After 2017, there was a noticeable decrease in tree cover loss, reaching a low around 2021. However, there appears to be an upward trend again in 2023.</li>
                            <li><b>Variability:</b>The graph indicates that tree cover loss in Indonesia varies widely, possibly influenced by factors such as deforestation activities, policy changes, and natural events like fires.</li>

                            <li><b>Decline in Recent Years:</b> After 2017, there was a steady decrease in greenhouse gas emissions, hitting a low around 2021. However, an uptick is visible again in 2023.</li>
                            <li><b>Variability:</b> The cyclical peaks and declines suggest that emissions are influenced by both policy measures and possibly natural or economic factors affecting industrial activities and land use.</li>

Emissions from this source began to decline after 2017 but saw an increase again in 2023.</li>
                            <li><b>Forestry:</b> Emissions from forestry activities are much lower compared to deforestation, remaining relatively stable with minor fluctuations over the years.</li>
                            <li><b>Shifting Agriculture:</b> Similar to forestry, emissions from shifting agriculture are relatively low and stable, showing minimal changes throughout the observed period.</li>

                            <li>Deforestation: Reduces habitats for endangered species (e.g., orangutans, Sumatran tigers), leading to population decline and fragmentation.</li>
                            <li>Pollution: Marine species are particularly affected by plastic pollution and water contaminants, disrupting food chains and habitats.</li>
